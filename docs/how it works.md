CrowSoft Cairo documentation
============================

Why is Spanish used in this project?

Cairo is a migration from a previous system which was writen in a mix of Spanish and English. A horrible mix. I want to translate all the code to English but this task will take some time.

I am an Spanish native speaker and I love my language. That said, I believe that English is the lingua franca in programming.
