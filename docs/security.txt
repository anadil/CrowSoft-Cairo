investigate this possible attack

a user puts html code in a description field (for example pr_descrip or fv_descrip)
this text is then rendered in the html (for example for fv_descript it is rendered
in the list_doc dialog)
using this a person can execute an script and get access when a user with
more privileges is listing the invoice.
maybe we should use encodeURIComponent in input control set text.
